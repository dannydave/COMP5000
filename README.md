Overview

This project is aimed at developing a database system for a local food delivery service in the USA. The delivery service currently stores order information in CSV files, but the goal is to transition to a more structured and efficient database solution using SQLite.

Project Objectives

* Database Design: Analyze and design a relational database schema based on the provided CSV files.

* Data Migration: Develop Python scripts to read the CSV files and populate the newly created SQLite database.

* Graphical User Interface (GUI): Create a user-friendly interface using Tkinter (or another GUI framework, excluding ipywidgets) to interact with the database.

Technologies Used

* SQLite for database management.

* Python for data processing and GUI development.

* Tkinter for GUI implementation.

Features

* Data import from multiple CSV files into SQLite.

* Database schema creation based on file structure.

* Basic querying and data display via the GUI.

* Ability to view, search, and potentially update order information through the GUI.

Learning Outcomes

* Database design and normalization.

* Python file handling and database interaction.

* GUI development with Tkinter.

* Combining data engineering, database management, and user interface design into a complete application.
