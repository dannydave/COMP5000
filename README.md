![Food Delivery](https://www.synergysuite.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/restaurant-food-delivery-2-1024x576.jpg)

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on designing and developing a lightweight database system for a local food delivery service in the USA. The business initially managed its orders through flat CSV files, but to improve efficiency and scalability, this project transitions the system to a structured **SQLite** database with a simple GUI for interacting with the data.

## 🎯 Objectives

* **Database Design**: Analyze CSV data and design a normalized relational database schema.
* **Data Migration**: Use Python scripts to extract data from CSV files and populate the SQLite database.
* **User Interface**: Develop a desktop GUI using Tkinter (or other frameworks excluding `ipywidgets`) to enable basic database interactions.

## 🛠️ Technologies

* **SQLite** – Lightweight, serverless database engine
* **Python** – For scripting, database access, and logic
* **Tkinter** – GUI toolkit for building interactive desktop applications

## ✨ Features

* 📥 **CSV to SQLite Import**: Seamlessly import order data from multiple CSV files.
* 🗂️ **Schema Creation**: Automatically generate database tables based on the data structure.
* 🔍 **GUI Interface**: View, search, and interact with order records through a user-friendly interface.
* ✏️ **Editable Data** : Potential to add, update, or delete orders from the GUI.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, you will gain hands-on experience with:

* Relational **database design** and **normalization**
* **Python scripting** for file handling and database interaction
* Building desktop applications with **Tkinter**
* Combining **data engineering**, **database management**, and **user interface design** into a unified solution
